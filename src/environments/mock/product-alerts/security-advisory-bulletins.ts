To avoid false negatives, we have not mapped feature rules for this advisory. It is recommended to manually check for the below POSSIBLE scenarios to determine if your device is vulnerable or not. \r\nThe devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server terminating SSL or DTLS connections or devices acting as an SSL client initiating an SSL or DTLS connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL or DTLS traffic without terminating it are not affected.  \r\n\r\nCisco IOS devices that support SSLVPN (AnyConnect) and have the feature configured and enabled are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAll Cisco IOS services that provide a form of TLS or SSL encryption are affected by this vulnerability. This includes features such as the HTTPS Web Management interface. Since HTTPS uses TLS so if that is configured you would be vulnerable.  However other solutions use TLS whose exhaustive list is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP - Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload. Customers are advised to apply the workaround as contained in the Workarounds section below. Fixed software information is available via the Cisco IOS Software Checker.

The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
