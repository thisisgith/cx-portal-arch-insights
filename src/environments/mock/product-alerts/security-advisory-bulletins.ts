These vulnerabilities include two Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication bypass vulnerabilities and two denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication bypass vulnerabilities are caused by a specific processing path followed when the device is setup to use a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server. These vulnerabilities may allow unauthenticated users to access either the internal network or the device itself. The two DoS vulnerabilities may be triggered when devices are terminating Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These denial of service vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to disconnect VPN users, prevent new connections, or prevent the device from transmitting traffic. These vulnerabilities are distributed in the authentication, IPSec VPN, and SSL VPN code. They are categorized in this advisory by their Cisco bug descriptions: LDAP Authentication Bypass Denial of Service in VPNs with Password Expiry Denial of Service in SSL VPNs Cisco has made free software available to address these vulnerabilities for affected customers.

The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted. A number of Cisco products ship with or use an affected version of the Bash shell. The Bash shell is a third-party software component that is part of the GNU software project and used by a number of software vendors. As of this version of the Security Advisory, there have been a number of vulnerabilities recently discovered in the Bash shell, and the investigation is ongoing. For vulnerable products, Cisco has included information on the product versions that will contain the fixed software, and the date these versions are expected to be published on the cisco.com download page. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco may release free software updates that address this vulnerability if a product is determined to be affected by this vulnerability.",

This includes features such as the HTTPS Web Management interface. Since HTTPS uses TLS so if that is configured you would be vulnerable.  However other solutions use TLS whose exhaustive list is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.

This vulnerability is publicly known as FragmentSmack. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. An attack could be executed by an attacker who can submit a stream of fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are designed to trigger the issue on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly algorithms in the IP stack that is used by the affected kernel. Linux Kernel Versions 3.9 and later are known to be affected by this vulnerability.",

Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM). Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.",

Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM). Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.",

					"bulletinVersion": "1.29",
					"summaryText": "On September 24, 2014, a vulnerability in the Bash shell was publicly announced. The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted. A number of Cisco products ship with or use an affected version of the Bash shell. The Bash shell is a third-party software component that is part of the GNU software project and used by a number of software vendors. As of this version of the Security Advisory, there have been a number of vulnerabilities recently discovered in the Bash shell, and the investigation is ongoing. For vulnerable products, Cisco has included information on the product versions that will contain the fixed software, and the date these versions are expected to be published on the cisco.com download page. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco may release free software updates that address this vulnerability if a product is determined to be affected by this vulnerability.",

In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the Fixed Software section for more information. A vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition. The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests. To be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited also depends on the accessibility of the interface to the attacker.

Only Typhoon-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of packets that are routed via the bridge-group virtual interface (BVI) when any of the following features are configured: Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), policy-based routing (PBR), quality of service (QoS), or access control lists (ACLs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv4 packets through an affected device that is configured to route them via the BVI interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and the line card that is processing traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by implementing a malicious TLS or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) client, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected server, or a malicious TLS or DTLS server, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected client. An exploit could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS heartbeat packet to the connected client or server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a limited portion of memory from a connected client or server for every heartbeat packet sent. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information that may include private keys and passwords. Please note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as an SSL server terminating SSL connections or devices acting as an SSL Client initiating an SSL connection.

					"summaryText": "2015-July-08 UPDATE: Cisco PSIRT is aware of disruption to some Cisco customers with Cisco ASA devices affected by CVE-2014-3383, the Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability that was disclosed in this Security Advisory. Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM). Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.",

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, blackhole traffic, and intercept traffic. The attacker could trigger this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause flushing of the routing table on a targeted router, as well as propagation of the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.

These vulnerabilities include: Cisco IOS XR Software will reset a BGP peering session when receiving a specific invalid BGP update. The vulnerability manifests when a BGP peer announces a prefix with a specific invalid attribute. On receipt of this prefix, the Cisco IOS XR device will restart the peering session by sending a notification. The peering session will flap until the sender stops sending the invalid/corrupt update. This vulnerability was disclosed in revision 1.0 of this advisory. Cisco IOS XR BGP process will crash when sending a long length BGP update message When Cisco IOS XR sends a long length BGP update message, the BGP process may crash. The number of AS numbers required to exceed the total/maximum length of update message and cause the crash are well above normal limits seen within production environments. Cisco IOS XR BGP process will crash when constructing a BGP update with a large number of AS prepends If the Cisco IOS XR BGP process is configured to prepend a very large number of Autonomous System (AS) Numbers to the AS path, the BGP process will crash. The number of AS numbers required to be prepended and cause the crash are well above normal limits seen within production environments.

The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM).

					"summaryText": "2015-July-08 UPDATE: Cisco PSIRT is aware of disruption to some Cisco customers with Cisco ASA devices affected by CVE-2014-3383, the Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability that was disclosed in this Security Advisory. Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM). Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.",

					"summaryText": "A vulnerability in the logic that handles access control to one of the hardware components in Cisco's proprietary Secure Boot implementation could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write a modified firmware image to the component. This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality. The vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.
